# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I use to practice my Python skills. The projects are organized into folders, each of which contains a README file that describes the project.

## Projects

* Tic Tac Toe/script.py: An interactive program for the user.
* War/script.py: An interactive card game.
* Blackjack/script.py: An interactive card game.
